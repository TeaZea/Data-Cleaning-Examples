# Mock SAS Data Cleaning
### TLDR;
This is an example of a program that is used on a regular basis to clean dirty data. The example utelizes a fake dataset from Mockaroo. The model uses similar attributes and types of values to it's real world application. The main purpose is to do a basic clean of the data;
removing any duplicates and unnecessary columns and leaving a condensed list of POs that would need to be cross-referenced with a seperate dataset.
